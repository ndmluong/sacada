Many current models corral the infectious period to shorter time periods than what virological studies have suggested, with one recent study suggesting that duration of viral detectability overestimates the infectious period on average by 2–6 days"". van Kampden et al 2021 ""The median duration of shedding infectious virus is 8 days post onset of symptoms (IQR 5–11)""";"[@Byrne2020;@vanKampen2021]"

""There are few data to inform asymptomatic infectious period (T2 parameter). One study provide data that suggest a median period of 4–9.5 days; however, given the viral dynamics, this distribution could have an extended tail with low probability long infectious periods of up to 20 days.""
